euler
=====
This repository contains the problems I solved for [project euler](http://projecteuler.net/). Every solution is on the branch `main` rather than `master` in order to hide the repository from google's search engine.

Running
-------
Each solution can be modified with `#define` at the begging of the source file. A script is provided in order to quickly compile and test a solution. To test a solution inside the `problems` folder, the basic syntax is : 
```bash
$ ./run "folder's name"
```
For more options, please `./run --help`.
